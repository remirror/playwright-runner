# @jestify/unit

A jest runner that runs unit tests with
[playwright](https://github.com/Microsoft/playwright).

1. The users test code, for example `something.spec.tsx`, is compiled into
   modern javascript with es6 imports.
2. The compiled test code is run directly in the browser.
3. The test code imports something. Playwright intercepts the http request
   and...
   - if it is local, such as `import './App.tsx'`, that new file is compiled to
     modern javascript and returned.
   - if it is a module, such as `import 'react'`, the parent node process is
     used to resolve the module. Browserify is used to bundle it, and the bundle
     is returned.
