## About

To provide the best web testing experience, we need to write our own web test
runner. To make the test runner, we use the
[jest platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtjyeojAOBs).

The runner comes in two flavors:

- **@jestify/e2e** Tests run in node, and control one or more web pages. Code
  coverage and other metadata is taken from the browser, rather than node. One
  node process is used to connect to mulitple parallel browser processes.

- **jest-runner-playwright-unit** Tests run in the browser. Code is transformed
  from node-style to web-style on the fly. This is a mostly drop-in replacement
  for JSDOM. Preliminary tests show this to be faster to startup and faster to
  run than JSDOM code!
